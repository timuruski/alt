ALT

A tiny tool for converting between source and test file. The following
convention is applied to all transformations.

    $ alt lib/alt/example.rb
    > spec/alt/example_spec.rb

    $ alt spec/alt/example_spec.rb
    > lib/alt/example.rb

Alt doesn't care whether a file exists, since you might be jumping from
source into a test file that doesn't exist, or vice versa.

TODO:

- handle test-unit naming style, test_example.rb
- ignore app/ directory same as lib/
